# CSS Portfolio

## Description

I completed the task of creating a portfolio page on Github. The goal was to showcase my
skills to potential employers. I utilized flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables
to create a responsive layout that adapts to different devices. Having a deployed portfolio is
essential for job interviews, and this project sets me up for future success. Overall, I created
a valuable tool for my career growth.

## User Story

AS A developer

I WANT a potential employer to view my deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT they can review samples of my work and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a potential employer to sample my previous work

WHEN they load my portfolio

THEN they are presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me

WHEN they click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN they click on the link to the section about my work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN they are presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN they click on the images of the applications

THEN they are taken to that deployed application

WHEN they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
