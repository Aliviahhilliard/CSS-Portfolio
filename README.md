# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

I completed the task of creating a portfolio page on Github. The goal was to showcase my 
skills to potential employers. I utilized flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables 
to create a responsive layout that adapts to different devices. Having a deployed portfolio is 
essential for job interviews, and this project sets me up for future success. Overall, I created
a valuable tool for my career growth.

## Getting Started

AS A developer
I WANT a potential employer to view my deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT they can review samples of my work and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need a potential employer to sample my previous work
WHEN they load my portfolio
THEN they are presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN they click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN they click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN they are presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN they click on the images of the applications
THEN they are taken to that deployed application
WHEN they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport


## Mock-Up
