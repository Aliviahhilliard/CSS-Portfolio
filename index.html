            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I have been a stay at home parent for the past decade. It has been an amazingly challenging role. During this time
              I also became a Genealogist. The puzzle solving, investigative work that goes into researching and tracking down
              my and others families history sparked my interest towards another topic: coding. While I have heard the developer lingo
              for many years, as my husband is a senior developer, I wanted to know the ins and outs of creating projects of my own. Namely a 
              program that is specified towards the way my brain works. One for genealogy, another for household management, another for gardening. 
              The possibilites seem endless. I decided to sign up for a coding Bootcamp through Ohio State University. It has been challenging but 
              very rewarding learning from the ground up to be a full stack developer. Ultimately, I aspire to have a career in developing by the time the Bootcamp
              is finished.
